-- Communitas.lua map script --

  Created by:
- Cephalo (Rich Marinaccio)		- Perlin landform, elevation and rainfall creation
- Sirian (Bob Thomas)			- Island creation, some code from Continents and Terra scripts
- WHoward69						- Mountain-pass finding algorithm
- Thalassicus (Victor Isbell)	- Ocean rifts, rivers through lakes, natural wonder placement,
								  resource placement, map options, inland seas, aesthetic polishing


This map script generates climate based on a simplified model of geostrophic
and monsoon wind patterns. Rivers are generated along accurate drainage paths
governed by the elevation map used to create the landforms.

- Natural wonders appear in useful locations.
- Islands reward exploration and settlement.
- Ocean rifts prevent ancient ships from circling the world.
- Lakes, and rivers flowing out of lakes.
- Terrain proportions more closely matching vanilla, with less rough terrain (hills/forest/jungle).
